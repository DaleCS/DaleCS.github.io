# My Web Portfolio

This is my web portfolio that I developed using React. It is deployed as a GitHub page.

## How to run locally:

1. Clone repository
2. `cd` to root project directory. If you're using `nvm`, run `nvm use` to use the same node version that was used to develop this
3. Run locally using `npm start`.

Optionally if you have docker and docker-compose, you can run with `npm run dev`
